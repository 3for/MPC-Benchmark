INTRODUCTION
------------

This package contains an implementation of the Low Cost Constant Round Short Keys MPC protocol.

A general explanation of the protocol can be found at



INSTALLATION AND EXECUTION
--------------------------

In order to compile and run The LowCostConstantRoundShortKeysMPC application:
1. Go in the LowConstConstantRoundShortKeysMPC directory.
2. Run the cmake . command.
3. Run the make command.
4. to execute run :

./LowCostConstantRoundShortKeysMPC -partyID [party_id] -circuitFile [circuit_file_name] -partiesFile [parties_file_name]
                            -inputsFile [input_file_name] -otherInputsFile [other_input_file_name] -keySize [key_size]
                            -isLookup [is_lookup] -internalIterationsNumber [internal_iterations_number]

 for example:
 ./LowCostConstantRoundShortKeysMPC -partyID 0 -circuitFile AES_splitters_scapi_5Parties.txt -partiesFile Parties
                                    -inputsFile AesInputs0.txt -otherInputsFile AesInputs1.txt -keySize 8
                                    -isLookup false -internalIterationsNumber 10

 This executes party number 0 of protocol.
